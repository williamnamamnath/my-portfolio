        <Paragraph>
        At the moment, I currently work at the Montreal Children Hospital as an administrative agent. However, I am actively looking for a position in web development. Since graduating in May, I have taken on a freelance contract from one of the colleagues I currently work with. <Anchor href="/nfib">Feel free to take a look!</Anchor>

        During my free time, I enjoy learning and acquiring new skills. I am currently learning <span style={{color: "#01A7C2"}}>Typescript</span> and am looking forward to learning about other tech stacks and libraries.

        <H3>My Hobbies üèÄ</H3>

        If I‚Äôm not coding, you can find me playing basketball, listening to music or watching movies.

        <h1 style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}>My Coding Philosophy</h1>
        <Paragraph>
        As a developer, I believe patience is a key attribute to possess. As someone that enjoys taking on challenges, I understand that problem-solving is a skill that can‚Äôt be mastered overnight and I am willing to put in the time and effort to get over any obstacle. 
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
        Moreover, attention to detail is an essential and valuable aspect that I take pride in. As a developer that enjoys making sure that every frame is to my liking, I only provide my maximum effort to make sure that the product I deliver is of excellent quality, whether I‚Äôm working on a personal project or working in teams. 
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
        Lastly, as a developer, it is important that one stays organized. Whether we‚Äôre talking about team planning or something as simple as how you arrange your files in your project, it can be easy to lose track of your work and your progress. Therefore, staying organized is essential and is a quality that can be easy to neglect.
