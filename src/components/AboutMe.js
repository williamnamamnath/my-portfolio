        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>The ability to create websites has always been a point of interest for me. The creativity, as well as the attention to detail, are qualities that I believe are required in this domain. 
        <br/>
        That is why I am excited to be able to start working on projects professionally. My objective is to have my work ethic and my passion for web development be reflected in my work so that my clients can have the best and easiest experience possible.</p>
