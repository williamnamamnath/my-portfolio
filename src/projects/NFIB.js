                        <Paragraph>
                            Project NFIB is a freelance project that was proposed to me by one of the medical geneticists that I work with at the Montreal University Health Centre (MUHC) from the genetics department.
                        </Paragraph> 
                            <Paragraph>
                                The goal of this website is to provide more information on how the pediatric and adult clinics work. NFIB or NF1, which stand for Neurofibromatosis or Neurofibromatosis Type 1 respectively, is still a genetic disease that needs more discussion as it is not talked about enough.
                            </Paragraph> 
                            <Paragraph>
                                With the help of this website, patients and their families will be able to get more information on NFIB/NF1 and how to send their referrals to the genetics department at the MUHC among other benefits.
