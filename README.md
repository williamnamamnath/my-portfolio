# Welcome to the repository of my portfolio project!

## Initial Reflection

I was very excited to work on this project since I love displaying my creativity and trying out different things since this is a personal project. However, because time was limited to create this portfolio from scratch, it was a bit hard doing only the minimum in order to submit this project. That being said, I definitely plan on making new modifications to it once I've submitted. For instance, I will definitely make my website look more aesthetically pleasing, I'll add subtle but cool effects and of course, I'll keep adding to my list of projects in my Projects section of the portfolio as I keep working on various workshops and/or projects that struck me in some way. 

Having said all this, when I first started the project, I was definitely thinking too big with the limited time that was given. However, I knew for sure I wanted to keep my navigation bar clean, simple and not too crowded with buttons. In it includes my socials such as my Github, my LinkedIn as well as a link to the contact section of my website (which there is also a contact button at the bottom of the main page). 

Also, my initial plan was to have all of my sections of my website on one page but since I wanted my portfolio to look cleaner and more presentable as a "first contact" when the user first visits my website, I decided to place each section of my website in a page of their own. However, to facilitate navigation to those pages, I added buttons at the bottom of the intro/main page. 

## Potential Additions to my Portfolio

I wanted to talk about myself but since I already decided on having a section on different pages (and that I might write a lot about myself), I decided to display a very brief introduction about myself as well as the skills that I learned throughout the bootcamp on my intro/main page. That way, I feel like it would captivate any potential recruiter's attention right away about what I can offer, then they can visit a more in-depth section about who I really am. 

I also planned on adding a "back to the top" button but seeing as I am separating my website in different sections, I decided to add a home button to each section to make it easier coming back to the main page. 

In addition, I was sold on making my name the "title" of the website, which can be found on the left side of the nav bar. Users can also click on my name to go back to the intro/main page. 

Lastly, I did add a form section but I will most likely make some modifications to it (maybe add my socials again that section). For now, it does the trick but there is always room for improvement and seeing as I am a perfectionist, I will look into ways that I can make not only the contact section better, but also the portfolio as a whole. 

## Final Message

As I said in the beginning, this version of my portfolio feels like a "rough draft" of what I really plan on doing, but I am definitely satisfied with what it looks like as of now and all the work I've put into it.
