# Welcome to my portfolio!

## Introduction

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My portfolio displays more information on who I am, my philosophy as a developer, my education level as well as my past projects. Fell free to reach out should you have any questions or inquiries! ðŸ˜Š 

## Potential Additions to my Portfolio

I wanted to talk about myself but since I already decided on having a section on different pages (and that I might write a lot about myself), I decided to display a very brief introduction about myself as well as the skills that I learned throughout the bootcamp on my intro/main page. That way, I feel like it would captivate any potential recruiter's attention right away about what I can offer, then they can visit a more in-depth section about who I really am. 

I also planned on adding a "back to the top" button but seeing as I am separating my website in different sections, I decided to add a home button to each section to make it easier coming back to the main page. 

In addition, I was sold on making my name the "title" of the website, which can be found on the left side of the nav bar. Users can also click on my name to go back to the intro/main page. 

Lastly, I did add a form section but I will most likely make some modifications to it (maybe add my socials again that section). For now, it does the trick but there is always room for improvement and seeing as I am a perfectionist, I will look into ways that I can make not only the contact section better, but also the portfolio as a whole. 

## Final Message

As I said in the beginning, this version of my portfolio feels like a "rough draft" of what I really plan on doing, but I am definitely satisfied with what it looks like as of now and all the work I've put into it.
